           In 2017, During My MBA, I Went On A College Trip To Dubai That Changed Everything. As I Soaked In The City's Vibrant Energy, I Couldn't Help But Notice The Lack Of    <span className="highlight">
             Professional Planning
           </span> For Large Group Trips Like Ours. The Whole Experience Could Have Been So Much Smoother And More Impactful With The Right Guidance And Attention To Detail. That's When I Realized A Major Opportunity: People Needed <span className="highlight">
             Expertly Planned Corporate And Student Trips
           </span> That Could Deliver Unique And Memorable Experiences.

           But This Dream Didn't Start In Dubaiâ€”It Actually Began A Few Years Earlier, Back In My BBA Days. That's When I Founded <span className="highlight">
             Tourwatchout
           </span> As A Small Venture Focused On Planning Family Vacations And Honeymoon Packages. My First Project Was Organizing A Family Trip, And I Loved Every Moment Of Making It Special For Them. Little By Little, I Started Managing Trips For Friends And Family, Developing A Love For Travel Planning And Creating Unforgettable Memories. After My Dubai Trip, I Knew It Was Time To Grow Tourwatchout Into Something Bigger. We Expanded From Family And Honeymoon Travel To Include <span className="highlight">
             Corporate Group Trips
           </span>
           , Student Excursions, And Everything In Between. Today, With <span className="highlight">
             10+ Years Of Experience
           </span>
           , Tourwatchout Is All About Delivering Seamless, Extraordinary Travel For Everyone, From Families To Corporate Teams.
